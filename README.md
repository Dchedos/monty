C - Stacks, Queues - LIFO, FIFO. Monty 0.98 is a scripting language that is first compiled into Monty byte codes (Just like Python). It relies on a unique stack, with specific instructions to manipulate it. Monty bytecode interpreter is made in the C programming language to manage stacks and queues (LIFO and FIFO), implemented with doubly linked lists. The goal of this project is to create an interpreter for Monty ByteCodes files. Monty language aims to close the gap between scripting and programming languages
